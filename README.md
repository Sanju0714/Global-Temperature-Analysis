# Global-Temperature-Analysis
A Python project analyzing global temperature trends over the last 20 years.
Project Title: Global Temparature Analysis.
Description: Description: Developed a Python-based data analysis project to investigate global temperature trends over the last 20 years. The project involved data cleaning, processing, and visualization of temperature anomalies, providing insights into climate change.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Acquisition: Retrieved and processed global temperature data from a public dataset using Pandas.
Data Cleaning: Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and formatting issues, preparing the dataset for analysis.
Data Analysis: Computed yearly average temperatures and anomalies to identify trends and variations in global temperatures.
Data Visualization: Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate temperature changes and anomalies over time.
Insights Generation: Analyzed the data to summarize key findings, including the global mean temperature and significant temperature anomalies.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy

Results:

Identified a 0.77Â°C increase in average global temperature over the last two decades.
Highlighted significant temperature anomalies, with the maximum anomaly recorded in 2024.

Installation Instructions: The project can be compiled using python3 compiler (e.g., required libraries are numpy,pandas,matplotlib).
